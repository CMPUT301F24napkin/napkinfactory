# Napkin Factory

This is the 301 project for the team napkin.

It is done by Stefan, Abs, Shaheer, David, Julian, and Andy.

We designed and implemented a simple, attractive, and easy-to-use Android application to satisfy the following goals. Our design is flexible enough to allow developers to extend or migrate it.

We implemented a mobile application where people could sign up for events at community centers that were popular and filled up fast. We ensured that people with limitations such as work or disabilities could sign up for these events fairly without having to refresh a webpage repeatedly for a chance at reserving a spot.

How? Lottery! When running swimming lessons for 20 kids, event organizers could post their events or series of events and allow everyone to join a waiting list for a week. After the week was up, the system would randomly choose 20 kids to sign up and notify them (or their guardians). If someone declined, the system would select another child to take the spot. Organizers could monitor the progress and access the final list of everyone who signed up. If someone canceled later, organizers could cancel their spot in the app, and a new applicant would be drawn.

Lottery systems worked well because participants only needed to express interest, and if selected, they were offered a chance to attend. This approach gave people the time to sign up properly without time pressure, promoting accessibility.
